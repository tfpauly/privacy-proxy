1.  Introduction

   CONNECT [RFC7231] and CONNECT-UDP [I-D.ietf-masque-connect-udp] are
   HTTP methods that clients may use to establish TCP or UDP flows to
   target servers.  Once proxy servers establish these flows, proxy
   servers treat allocated flows as opaque byte or datagram streams
   respectively.  Clients specify the target in authority-form
   (Section 5.3 of [RFC7230]), including the name or IP address of the
   server along with a port number.  When using a name instead of an IP
   address, the proxy server locally resolves the name to an IPv4 or
   IPv6 address with A or AAAA queries.  The client does not see these A
   or AAAA answers, as they are only relevant to the proxy in
   establishing a connection to the target.

   In some circumstances, some DNS metadata may be useful to clients.
   This is especially true for information contained in Service Binding
   (SVCB or HTTPS) records [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https].  These records
   can influence client behavior even when clients are not directly
   interacting with target IP addresses.  The records can be used to
   determine which application-level protocols are supported by an
   endpoint.  These records also can include a TLS Encrypted Client
   Hello [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] configuration, which can be used in
   protecting the end-to-end TLS handshake.

   This document specifies HTTP header fields that proxy servers may use
   to relay information retrieved from SVCB records from proxy servers
   to clients when using CONNECT or CONNECT-UDP.

1.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  SVCB Request Header Field

   Clients can request SVCB parameters with the Structured Header
   [RFC8941] "DNS-SVCB-Keys".  Its value MUST be an sf-list whose
   members are sf-integer items that MUST NOT contain parameters.  Its
   ABNF is:

   DNS-SVCB-Keys = sf-list

   Each list member corresponds to the numeric version of an
   SvcParamKey.

   For example, a client wanting to receive ALPN and ECH Config
   parameters would send a request for 1 (alpn) and 5 (echconfig):

   HEADERS
   :method = CONNECT
   :authority = svc.example.com:443
   dns-svcb-keys = 1, 5

3.  SVCB Response Header Fields

   A proxy server that receives a request with "DNS-SVCB-Keys" MAY
   respond with the Structured Header "DNS-SVCB-Params" response header
   fields.  The value of "DNS-SVCB-Params" MUST be an sf-list whose
   members are sf-string, each of which MUST contain parameters.

   DNS-SVCB-Params = sf-list

   Each list member is an sf-string that represents the TargetName of a
   single received SVCB or HTTPS record.  The Parameters associated with
   each list member correspond to the SvcParam key-value pairs for that
   record, the priority of the record, and the TTL of the record.

   The priority of the record MUST be a parameter with the key
   "priority", and a value as an sf-integer.  Alias forms, with priority
   0, MUST NOT be included.

   The TTL of the record MUST be a parameter with the key "ttl", and a
   value as an sf-integer.

   Each SvcParam that matches a key requested by the client is a
   parameters with a key that is the character "p" followed by the
   numeric version of the SvcParamKey.  For example, the ALPN
   SvcParamKey, with the numeric value 1, would have a parameter key
   "p1".  The value of each parameter MUST be an sf-binary item that
   contains the bytes of the SvcParamValue.

   Proxy servers MUST NOT include the "DNS-SVCB-Params" response header
   field if the corresponding request did not include a "DNS-SVCB-Keys".
   Servers MAY include specific SvcParamKey values that were not
   requested.  Specifically, servers SHOULD include the "mandatory"
   parameter if present, which would be presented as "p0", along with
   any parameters that are defined as mandatory for that record.

   As an example, assume that the server received the following
   "svc.example.com" SVCB records:

      svc.example.com. 3600 IN HTTPS 1 svc2.example.com. alpn=h2,h3 echconfig="123..."
      svc.example.com. 3600 IN HTTPS 2 . alpn=h2 echconfig="abc..."

   A successful CONNECT response would include the following headers, if
   the client requested both "alpn" and "echconfig":

   HEADERS
   :method = CONNECT
   :status = 200
   dns-svcb-params = "svc2.example.com.";priority=1;ttl=3600;p1=:aDIsaDM=:;p5=:MTIzLi4u:,
                     "svc.example.com.";priority=2;ttl=3600;p1=:aDI=:;p5=:YWJjLi4u:

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  HTTP Headers

   This document registers the "DNS-SVCB-Keys" and "DNS-SVCB-Params",
   headers in the "Permanent Message Header Field Names"
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers>.

     +----------------------+----------+--------+---------------+
     | Header Field Name    | Protocol | Status |   Reference   |
     +----------------------+----------+--------+---------------+
     | DNS-SVCB-Keys        |   http   |  exp   | This document |
     +----------------------+----------+--------+---------------+
     | DNS-SVCB-Params      |   http   |  exp   | This document |
     +----------------------+----------+--------+---------------+

5.  Security Considerations

   The "DNS-SVCB-Params" header in Section 3 does not include any DNSSEC
   information.  Clients that depend on the contents of the SVCB record
   being DNSSEC-validated MUST NOT use this metadata without otherwise
   fetching the record and its corresponding RRSIG record and locally
   verifying its contents.
