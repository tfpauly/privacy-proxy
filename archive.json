      "body": "This is a radically different looking approach to solve a somewhat different but related problem. We would like clients to produce tokens that are a function of their IP address, an issuer secret parameter, and the origin where the token is displayed. We'd like these tokens not to be linkable across sites, but not mangleable on a site. IP address is used as an example, other identifiers could also work.\r\n\r\nTo do this I propose the following: The Issuer  I takes a request from a client C, computes z=h(IP(C), secret) for some hash function h, and sends back z along with a structure signature of a special value zg_1,zg_2  with a structure preserving signature on zg_1, zg_2. Maybe we have to fiddle a bit with this. The client just has to do this once.\r\n\r\nThe client connects to a site S by computing w=H(S), T=zw, where H is a hash function to G_1. The client then sends a zero knowledge Groth-Sahai proof that T is correctly formed (by pairing equations involving the special value) and that the issuer signed the special value. The special value isn't revealed by the ZK properties of the Groth-Sahai proof.\r\n\r\nThe site can use T the way it uses IP addresses today. Crucially a different site will have a different token T', with no way to link them. \r\n\r\nThis has a number of differences from the current proposal:\r\n\r\n- The mediator doesn't exist\r\n- Issuer works once per client\r\n- Sites implement their own policies freely, and can use the identifier to link repeated requests, e.g. to find a pattern of vandalism and respond with a ban\r\n- Sites get an equivalent to the IP address they currently use\r\n- Uses more complicated cryptography, but conceptually pretty simple: validate a token, generate a token, issue a signature\r\n- The issuer is stateless",

It prefers rooting the authentication on a device or account. Maintaining the IP address stability is one way to provide some of the existing behavior, but I'm hoping to have something that doesn't have some of the annoying properties of rate-limiting per IP (users behind a NAT are forced to share fate), and allows us to use private IPs to talk to the mediator/issuer infrastructure.\r\n\r\n- If the client only talks to the Issuer once, and can mint its own tokens after that for a specific origin, either it will be presenting the same token to the same origin over an over (which I think is the case you have here) or it would be able to mint new tokens and look like as many users as it wants. If this is the former case, then we effectively have a super-cookie that allows a server to recognize the same client coming back. That's an anti-goal of Private Access Tokens. We want a way to ensure that the server cannot recognize a client coming back to them, even if they're on the same access network, if they cleared cookies.\r\n\r\n- If the Issuer is chosen by the Origin, and the Client must directly talk to the Issuer using a non-private IP, the Origin now has the power to tell the Client to reach out to an arbitrary site with its real IP address. This is a regression in privacy, I think; for PATs, the Client only ever reveals its IP address to a Mediator it chooses and trusts, not an arbitrary Issuer (which could be the Origin itself). Yes, the Issuer may not know your actual identity, but it can track where users are and build up state if it wants.",

You raise some excellent points.\r\n\r\n- IP could really be any string: email, account name, some attestation key. All that is important is that it be expensive to obtain another one. \r\n- You're correct that we'd present the same token over and over. For anti-abuse use cases this is more compelling than the paywall usecase. However it's possible to periodize the credentials: instead of W=H(S), make it W=H(S, t) where t is the current time rounded to some precision. This doesn't require another Issuer interaction.\r\n- The Origin (perhaps a better name is needed... but it's hard to come up with one) and Client would have to agree upon a mutually agreeable Issuer, although this is a one time event. If the Client just takes any Issuer, and that changes every time, that would be a problem. How big a problem this is in a deployment depends on the number of Issuers and how widely they are trusted. My thought is that developers of Privacy Enhancing Technologies would be able to deploy these also. \r\n",

With a challenge-based system, the origin knows that the client had to fetch the token within a certain time; you could try to run the issuance through some other device that was more trusted than you, but you'd need to proxy for each new token challenge. If we only talk to an issuer to get a secret once, what stops a client from leaking that information to many other clients? The origin could still rate limit that entire group as \"one\", but it means that it's fairly trivial to start giving access to clients that otherwise wouldn't be trusted.\n\nI think what I'm seeing is that a model that tries to put enforcement back on the origin based on one-time information from an issuer can work as a replacement for some captcha-style use cases, but has more trouble with the cases like metered paywalls or trusting that a client is in a specific geolocation. Does that sound right? ",

For paywall metering the supercookie concern is an issue, especially on subrequests. If it's only presented on a top level navigation, given the paywall durations (typically per month) and limits (~10 views) it might not be so bad, provided we don't have additional, especially cross site tracking vectors. I think for captcha you really want one time tokens, not persistent ones because of the ability to farm.",

I see a couple problems with this:\r\n\r\n1. The policy limit isn't necessarily secret from the Attester anyway, since it (a) knows the per-client counts and (b) can see when the Issuer refuses to produce a token response. It can then infer what the limit is. It could even act as a malicious client to learn the per-origin limit if it wanted.\r\n2. The Issuer currently reveals when it refuses to process a token. We could change that by having it just randomize the token response in the event of failure, but then the Attester could just act as a client and learn whatever real clients learn, so this doesn't make much sense to me.\r\n3. Bucketizing the counts from Attester to Issuer seems leaky at best, especially since the right size of the buckets seems to depend on client activity. I don't know of a reasonable strategy here that would allow us to state concrete properties about what the Issuer can and cannot learn per client. And it seems like we want something like k-anonymity?\r\n\r\nI think we should instead have the Issuer send the Attester the per-origin policy limit, and then require the Attester to enforce the policy based on that limit. We already require origins to not have unique policies for privacy reasons, so this seems fine. Moreover, giving the Attester this policy information doesn't seem like revealing anything new. But it would mean that the origins now trust Attesters directly to enforce limits, rather than Issuers being the ones to do that. Since Attesters are already transitively trusted through Issuers, this doesn't seem like a stretch.",

Allow the client to pass some extra (blind?) signed value that indicates to the issuer they meet the appropriate criteria.

I get that \"issuer-key\" is arguably simpler, but it doesn't capture what the key actually does. It's a key for verifying tokens, regardless of issuance protocol. Confusion is compounded when referenced in the context of the rate-limited protocol, which has a pile of keys hanging around.\r\n\r\nI think we want the vocabulary here to be clear and descriptive.

This would be the format as described for IP geolocation feeds:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8805.html#name-geolocation-feed-individual\r\n\r\nExamples from that doc include:\r\n`SG,SG-01,Singapore`\r\n`US,US-AL,Alabaster`\r\n\r\nWe could define the header to share this as `Sec-CH-IP-Geo`, which would be an `sf-item` of type String.\r\n\r\nWhich could expand as:\r\n\r\n`Sec-CH-IP-Geo = \"US,US-AL,Alabaster\"`\r\n\r\nThe intent of this would be for the client to tell the server that it believes it knows the accurate mapping for its client IP, such that an origin server with an out-of-date or inaccurate geolocation feed doesn't do the wrong thing. This of course would not be a matter that could be used for access control or security, but it provides a hint that can be useful for localizing content and results without needing to share GPS coordinates.\r\n\r\nThis has an advantage over geohash in that it is more clearly tied to or derived from the client's public IP, and would be less likely to accidentally include information derived from GPS coordinates. It also presumably would not be exposing any new information that the server couldn't already infer from a properly updated geo IP database feed.\r\n\r\nWe could also include parameters associated with the value to point to which geo IP feed is authoritative for this mapping, such that an origin could go further and try to validate the mapping if it wants to make a trust decision based on the value. It could then compare the client's IP address, the header value, and the mapping in the geo IP feed, and if it trusts this feed provider, it would allow the action.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`Sec-CH-IP-Geo = \"SG,SG-01,Singapore\"; feed=\"https://noc.ietf.org/geo/google.csv\"`",

In particular, this yields a valid ECDSA signature `(r, s)` under a public key `blind_key = pk_blind = (sk_blind * sk_sign) * G` where `G` is the base point. Both the attester and issuer will accept this valid signature.\r\n\r\nNow, consider a second client\r\n* Client 2 registers to the attester with `pk2 = alpha^(-1) * pk_blind`, for a random `alpha`. \r\n\r\nNote that client 2 does not know the secret key associated with its public key `pk2`. However, it can send the **same** `context` and `(r, s)` as above, and a randomizer `sk_blind2 = alpha` to the attester. The attester will reconstruct `pk_blind2 = sk_blind2 * pk2 = pk_blind`, and verify the signature `(r, s)` against `pk_blind`, which is valid!\r\n\r\nWe end up in a setting where a client has sent a valid signature on a message without knowing the secret key. This is the same message `context` and signature as above.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, client 2  could generate a context\r\n```\r\ncontext2 =  concat(0x0003, token_key_id2, ..., encrypted_origin_name2)\r\n```\r\ncompute `beta = H(context2)/H(context) mod q`, and register with public key `pk3 = alpha^(-1) * beta * pk_blind`, and provide randomizer `sk_blind3 = alpha` and signature `(r, beta * s mod q)`. Once again, the client doesn't know the secret key `sk3` associated to `pk3`. Since this is an ECDSA signature, it holds that \r\n```\r\nbeta * s = k^(-1) (beta * H(context) + beta * sk_blind * sk_sign * r) mod q\r\n              = k^(-1) ( H(context2) + sk3 * r ) mod q\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the notion used in this part of the protocol does not rely on the unforgeability of the signature in the related key attack model. It would be valuable to specify which security properties are used from the ECDSA key blinding protocol, and what security properties they enable to prove for the rate-limited token issuance protocol.",

Here instead, there are two different channels (client \u2194 \u201cissuing party\u201d, client \u2194 origin), and to hide the client name from the \u201cissuing party\u201d, it is split in two parties (attester, and issuer).

      "body": "Ongoing work on analyzing this protocol found a potential issue with the current construction. Consider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. Client generates and sends a TokenRequest to the Attester.\r\n2. Attester validates the TokenRequest against the Client's long-term public key and forwards the TokenRequest to the Issuer.\r\n3. The attacker (or a malicious Attester) intercepts the forwarded TokenRequest, extracts TokenRequest.blinded_msg -- the blind signature message -- and constructs its own TokenRequest with a valid encrypted origin and signature, but replays TokenRequest.blinded_msg. \r\n4. The Issuer validates the request and returns a token response to the attacker.\r\n5. The attacker returns the response to the Attester, and the Attester returns the result to the Client after doing its rate limit check. \r\n\r\nIn essence, this means that an attacker can cause the Client to finish the issuance protocol with a token that was really issued under an origin that it did not choose, which is not a great property. This issue might arise a number of ways. The Attester<>Issuer channel might be compromised, or the Attester might be malicious (though the Attester is already assumed to be honest-but-curious here as it is responsible for enforcing rate limits, I don't think we want the properties of the issuance protocol to depend on the underlying channels used to send messages.) So I think this is something we ought to fix.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there's a couple ways we can address this (which were both proven to work). Briefly:\r\n\r\n1. Have the Issuer sign the token request and response transaction under a new-long term signing key.\r\n2. Encrypt the token request information with HPKE -- alongside the origin name -- to the Issuer, and have the Issuer encrypt and authenticate the response back to the Client under an HPKE-derived key. \r\n\r\nThe second option seems better, for a few reasons: (1) it can reuse established encap techniques from OHTTP and ODoH, (2) it ensures the attester really only learns what it needs to learn for the rate limiting enforcement (it doesn't need to see blind signature message in TokenRequest for that), and (3) it does not require any new long term key for the Issuer or signature verification on the Client. \r\n\r\nI'm going to prepare a PR for the second option, though I'd like to hear what folks think about this issue overall.",

      "body": "**Summary**: A client may be able to provide different public keys to the Attester and Issuer, resulting in an incorrect computation of the OPRF.\r\n\r\n**Details**:\r\n\r\nAccording to my best reading of the draft, the client generates a blinded key `request_key` and uses it to generate a signature on the encrypted token request.  The `request_key` is sent to the Issuer inside the encrypted `InnerTokenRequest`. Let me call this copy of the `request_key` _rk1_. The client also communicates this `request_key` and the corresponding `request_blind` to the Attester via a request header. Let me call this copy _rk2_. The Attester and Issuer both verify the signature on the encrypted token request; the Attester also verifies the correctness of `request_blind` with respect to _rk2_ and the client long-term public key. \r\n\r\nThe question I had: can the client specify a different `request_key` in the two places? If so, the OPRF computation will no longer be correct, which may allow you to get exceed the token rate limit. For this to work, you would need two different public keys such that the signature verifies correctly under both of them.\r\n\r\nPreventing such a construction is not a standard property of signature algorithms. The closest I could find was in this paper:\r\n\r\nThe Provable Security of Ed25519: Theory and Practice\r\nJacqueline Brendel, Cas Cremers, Dennis Jackson, and Mang Zhao\r\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2020/823 (also published at S&P 2021)\r\n\r\nThere they define a property called Malicious Strong Universal Exclusive Ownership (M-S-UEO) that says that the adversary cannot create two public keys _k, k'_ and two messages _m, m'_ such that Verify(m,k) = Verify(m,k') = True. This property is sufficient to prevent the above attack, though not strictly necessary, since in our case we also need for m = m'. \r\n\r\nThe paper proves that EdDSA is resilient to such attacks **only if** there is a check that avoids the small subgroup on Curve25519. Unfortunately, as the paper points out, RFC8032 does not specify such a check, though, e.g., libsodium implements it. Without the check, a small subgroup attack can be used for a relatively straightforward attack on M-S-UEO (as well as other key substitution attacks discussed in the paper). I have not checked whether this attack would work end-to-end in rate-limited tokens, but I suspect that subgroup confinement gives you a lot of attack freedom. \r\n\r\nThe other issue is that ECDSA is almost certainly not resilient to the kind of key substitution we are looking at here, since it doesn't bind the public key to the signature the way EdDSA does, and there are known key substitution attacks against DSA. Again, I have not checked whether an end-to-end attack would work, but I suspect it might. \r\n\r\n**Solution**:\r\n\r\nI think this attack can be addressed by making sure that the Attester and Issuer are using the same public key. A simple way to accomplish this would be to have the attester communicate its copy of `request_key` to the Issuer and then having the Issuer verify that the key inside the encrypted `InnerTokenRequest` matches the one from the Attester. A nice way to do this would be to include a cleartext `request_key` inside the `TokenRequest` structure and perhaps also including it in the signature.",

More specifically, suppose Alice visits foo.com and gets a challenge nonce from it. She then runs the issuance protocol, but specifies bar.com as the origin in the encrypted token request. As I understand it, as long as foo.com and bar.com both trust the same issuer, this would work because the origin only sees the (blind) signature from the issuer. \r\n\r\nAmong many potential problems resulting from this lack of binding is that bar.com may have a much higher rate limit than foo.com. \r\n\r\n@chris-wood suggests that perhaps a partially-blind signature could be used to fix this problem, where the issuer includes the origin as the public input to the partially-blind sig.",

      "body": "In the current proposal, the attester learns the rate limit specific to the origin. This reduces the anonymity set to origins that share a common rate. Below, I describe an idea that prevents the attester from learning this rate.\r\n\r\n## Simplified summary of current proposal:\r\n\r\n(as I understand it so far; for sake of comparison)\r\n\r\n1. client sends BlindSigReq to attester\r\n2. attester forwards BlindSigReq to issuer\r\n3. issuer responds with BlindSigResponse and the origin's RateLimit\r\n4. attester enforces RateLimit based on H(client,origin) pair\r\n5. if rate limit OK, attester forwards BlindSigResponse to client\r\n6. client unpacks to learn its desired blind signature token\r\n\r\n## Main idea\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to let the client request its entire quota of tokens in a single interaction, instead of requesting them one at a time. For this, I must make a distinction between an *interaction* and a *token*.\r\n\r\nLet's say that all rate limits are expressed in the units of `tokens / hour`. Then the attester will simply check that there is at most 1 interaction, per (client,origin) pair, per hour. The attester's check is the same for all origins (1 interaction per hour), regardless of their true rate limit. But each \"interaction\" results in the client learning many tokens. The issuer already knows the rate limit (expressed in tokens per hour) so it enforces the rate limit by only giving out the correct # of tokens in a single interaction.\r\n\r\n## Simplified summary of new proposal:\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity, I will assume that both client and issuer know the origin's desired rate limit.\r\nI will extend the notation so that BlindSigReq(n) <--> BlindSigResponse(n) is a blind signature protocol where the client learns n distinct signatures.\r\n\r\n1. client sends BlindSigReq(RateLimit) to attester, where RateLimit is the origin's limit\r\n2. attester forwards BlindSigReq(RateLimit) to issuer\r\n3. issuer responds with BlindSigResponse(RateLimit)\r\n4. attester checks: was there a prior request on this (client,origin) pair in the last hour?\r\n5. if no such prior request, then attester forwards BlindSigResponse(RateLimit) to client\r\n6. client unpacks to learn RateLimit number of blind signature token\r\n\r\nIn order to hide the rate limit from the attester, the BlindSig{Req,Response} protocol messages must hide the rate limit. I'm not sure if there are blind signatures or [V]OPRFs where the client can get several distinct tokens, in a protocol messages of constant size. However, I have some hope because the client mostly cares about the *number* of tokens learned, and is less concerned about what message is being signed. I.e., the client could learn signatures on a collection of *random* messages.\r\n\r\nIf such a blind signature or OPRF is not possible/feasible, then a trivial way to hide the rate limit is to pad the size of the protocol message to some maximum limit. One could also consider leaking only partial information about the rate limit -- e.g., round the rate limit up to the nearest power of two and pad the protocol messages to that size. A downside to this simple padding strategy is that it is wasteful of bandwidth by design.",

Just to confirm\u2014was the idea of having `proxy-match` as a separate dictionary rejected?\n\nWe have a use case where we run a Network Relay proxy for Apple devices that supports both HTTP/3 and HTTP/2, each served under a different hostname. Both endpoints share the same set of match domains. A simplified configuration could look like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"identifier\": \"mask.example.com\",\n    \"expires\": \"2023-06-23T06:00:00Z\",\n    \"prefixes\": [],\n    \"proxies\": [\n      {\n        \"protocol\": \"connect-udp\",\n        \"proxy\": \"https://mask.example.com:443/masque{?target_host,target_port}\",\n        \"alpn\": [\n          \"h3\"\n        ],\n        \"identifier\": \"network_relay\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"proxy-match\": [\n      {\n        \"domains\": [\n          \"*.internal.example.org\"\n        ],\n        \"proxies\": [\n          \"network_relay\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"identifier\": \"mask-h2.example.com\",\n    \"expires\": \"2023-06-23T06:00:00Z\",\n    \"prefixes\": [],\n    \"proxies\": [\n      {\n        \"protocol\": \"connect-udp\",\n        \"proxy\": \"https://mask-h2.example.com:443/masque{?target_host,target_port}\",\n        \"alpn\": [\n          \"h2\"\n        ],\n        \"identifier\": \"network_relay\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"proxy-match\": [\n      {\n        \"domains\": [\n          \"*.internal.example.org\"\n        ],\n        \"proxies\": [\n          \"network_relay\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nIs there currently a way in the draft spec to avoid this kind of proxy-match duplication when using the same logical proxy configuration under multiple hostnames?\n\nTo give some context: we use this setup both internally and for customers. Our internal configuration contains ~1,800 match domains, resulting in a ~160KB JSON file. With 11,000 clients fetching the config every 5 minutes, we would have ~20GB of bandwidth per hour just for downloading the configuration.\n\nAny suggestions for optimizing this? Thanks!",

And in some cases (VPN-like remote access) configuration can change rapidly.\n\nI think it would be great to include a \"version\" field (could be an opaque string) and propose a HTTP header for MASQUE proxies to include in their responses that would signal the latest proxy configuration version. This way client knows when its proxy config is outdated and needs to be refreshed.\n\nOn top of that we could specify that implementors should use Expires header as per RFC9111 for client to periodically refresh proxy configuration.\n\n@tfpauly @ddragana what do you think?",

The flip side, I suppose, would be if the proxy chooses a host whose ALPN list doesn't reflect the client's support, but that could be solved by requiring the server to choose based on the transport protocol implied by the method, and then preferring the default ALPN within that.  Alternatively, the client could include an ALPN list in the request.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's also totally reasonable to save that for a separate PR if we decide to do it.",

The media type for this request\r\nis \"message/access-token-request\".  The Client includes the \"Token-Origin\" header in\r\nthis request, whose value is ENCRYPTED_ORIGIN_NAME as described in {{POINTER}};\r\nand the \"Anonymous-Origin-ID\" header, whose value is ANON_ORIGIN_ID. The Client sends \r\nthis request to the Mediator's proxy URI.  An example request is shown below, where Nk = 512.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's text for {#POINTER}:\r\n\r\nGiven a `KeyConfig` (ISSUER_TOKEN_KEY), Clients produce ENCRYPTED_ORIGIN_NAME \r\nusing the following values:\r\n\r\n- the key identifier from the configuration, keyID, with the corresponding KEM identified by kemID,\r\nthe public key from the configuration, pkR, and;\r\n- a selected combination of KDF, identified by kdfID, and AEAD, identified by aeadID.\r\n\r\nBeyond the key configuration inputs, Clients also require the AccessTokenRequest\r\n`token_request` and ANONYMOUS_ORIGIN_ID `anon_origin_id`. Together, these\r\nare used to encapsulate ORIGIN_NAME `origin_name` and produce \r\n`encrypted_origin` as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Compute an HPKE context using pkR, yielding context and encapsulation key enc.\r\n1. Construct associated data, aad, by concatenating the values of keyID, kemID, kdfID, aeadID, `token_request`, and `anon_origin_id`, as one 8-bit integer, three 16-bit integers, the AccessTokenRequest struct, and the value of ANONYMOUS_ORIGIN_ID, respectively, each in network byte order.\r\n1. Encrypt (seal) request with aad as associated data using context, yielding ciphertext ct.\r\n1. Concatenate the values of aad, enc, and ct, yielding an Encapsulated Request enc_request.\r\n\r\nNote that enc is of fixed-length, so there is no ambiguity in parsing this structure.\r\n\r\nIn pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nenc, context = SetupBaseS(pkR, \"OriginTokenRequest\")\r\naad = concat(encode(1, keyID),\r\n             encode(2, kemID),\r\n             encode(2, kdfID),\r\n             encode(2, aeadID),\r\n             encode(len(token_request), token_request),\r\n             encode(32, anon_origin_id))\r\nct = context.Seal(aad, origin_name)\r\nencrypted_origin = concat(aad, enc, ct)\r\n```\r\n\r\nENCRYPTED_ORIGIN_NAME is then set to `encrypted_origin`.",

Did you mean \"leave it in\" or \"leave it out\"?\r\n\r\nLet me share my thoughts on two things anyway:\r\n\r\n- I think this depends in part on what this document is outlining. I think it outlines an architecture as well as a protocol. Given it does both, I would argue that the architecture is employed here for _all_ of these use cases.\r\n\r\n- I agree that the solution here is going to be limited to per-country or per-region and not arbitrary geo-location. I'm not sure I understand the proposal though, since at the moment the only way we can do this now is with key per region, and I agree that this won't scale beyond per country-ish numbers. However, you can either do it or not... and we don't have the other necessary crypto bits yet. I would love to work on that separately (and understand where the crypto required for that stands), but per-country geo locating, while a bit limited, is a pretty important use case.",

A workaround would be to derive the nonce _from_ the connection via [the Export API](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#section-7.5) (client and server independently call the API to get a nonce and if they disagree they know there's a TLS interceptor), but that's pretty uncommon. Things like WebAuthn have [slots for this type of binding](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#dom-collectedclientdata-tokenbinding) but it's basically never used in practice. ",

The parsing will be easier as well.\r\nMaybe excludedPorts should be use only without matchPorts, to define ports that are disallowed, i.e. use one or the other.\r\nWe should also define that ports above 65535 is an error, do we want to reject the configuration or just ignore the mistake?\r\n\r\nI think we should have a limit of the number of elements in the arrays, or a recommendation that the arrays should not be longer than x elements because the implementation may reject it. Also we should define the behavior in this case, e.g. the config is rejected as a whole or elements after element x are ignored. This is a separate issue though, and I will open a new issue for it.",

This seems to suggest that the client can/should continue looking for more matches after making a match, but that conflicts with the \"first match\" rule proposed just before. Are there some cases where clients can/should continue looking for rule matches? If so, when is that OK to do? Is this just a matter of preference levels, except for empty proxy sets, which always mean \"stop here\"?\r\n> On a related note, what if I have a proxy-match none of whose proxy identifiers apply to the protocol, e.g., a TCP connection but the identified proxy only has \"connect-udp\"? Should the client consider that \"not a match\" and continue looking for more rules? Or stop and declare no proxy available?",
