1.  Introduction

   HTTP proxies that use the CONNECT method defined in Section 9.3.6 of
   [HTTP] (often referred to as "forward" proxies) allow clients to open
   connections to hosts via a proxy.  These typically allow for TCP
   stream proxying, but can also support UDP proxying [CONNECT-UDP] and
   IP packet proxying [CONNECT-IP].  The locations of these proxies are
   not just defined as hostnames and ports, but can use URI templates
   [URITEMPLATE].

   In order to make use of multiple related proxies, clients need a way
   to understand which proxies are associated with one another, and
   which protocols can be used to communicate with the proxies.

   Client can also benefit from learning about additional information
   associated with the proxy to optimize their proxy usage, such knowing
   that a proxy is configured to only allow access to a limited set of
   destinations.

   These improvements to client behavior can be achieved through the use
   of Provisioning Domains.  Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined in
   [PVD] as consistent sets of network configuration information, which
   can include proxy configuration details Section 2 of [PVD].
   Section 4.3 of [PVDDATA] defines a JSON [JSON] format for describing
   Provisioning Domain Additional Information, which is an extensible
   dictionary of properties of the Provisioning Domain.

   This document defines several mechanisms to use PvDs to help clients
   understand how to use proxies:

   1.  A way to fetch PvD Additional Information associated with a known
       proxy URI (Section 2)

   2.  A way to list one or more proxy URIs in a PvD, allowing clients
       to learn about other proxy options given a known proxy
       (Section 3).

   3.  A way to define the set of destinations that are accessible
       through the proxy (Section 4).

   Additionally, this document partly describes how these mechanisms
   might be used to discover proxies associated with a network
   (Section 5).

   Using this mechanism a client can learn that a legacy insecure HTTP
   proxy that the client is configured with is also accessible using
   HTTPS.  In this way, clients can upgrade to a more secure connection
   to the proxy.

1.1.  Background

   Other non-standard mechanisms for proxy configuration and discovery
   have been used historically, some of which are described in
   [RFC3040].

   Proxy Auto Configuration (PAC) files Section 6.2 of [RFC3040] are
   Javascript scripts that take URLs as input and provide an output of a
   proxy configuration to use.

   Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD) Section 6.4 of [RFC3040]
   allows networks to advertise proxies to use by advertising a PAC
   file.  This solution squats on DHCP option 252.

   These common (but non-standard) mechanisms only support defining
   proxies by hostname and port, and do not support configuring a full
   URI template [URITEMPLATE].

   The mechanisms defined in this document are intended to offer a
   standard alternative that works for URI-based proxies and avoids
   dependencies on executing Javascript scripts, which are prone to
   implementation-specific inconsistencies and can open up security
   vulnerabilities.

1.2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Fetching PvD Additional Information for proxies

   This document defines a way to fetch PvD Additional Information
   associated with a proxy.  This PvD describes the properties of the
   network accessible through the proxy.

   In order to fetch PvD Additional Information associated with a proxy,
   a client issues an HTTP GET request for the well-known PvD URI
   (".well-known/pvd") as defined in Section 4.1 of [PVDDATA] and the
   host authority of the proxy.  This is applicable for both proxies
   that are identified by a host and port only (such as SOCKS proxies
   and HTTP CONNECT proxies) and proxies that are identified by a URI or
   URI template.  The fetch MUST use the "https" scheme.  By default,
   the fetch SHOULD use the standard port for HTTP over TLS (443) and
   the ".well-known/pvd" path.  However, both the port and the path MAY
   be overridden by local configuration policy on the client.

   It is not necessary for the client to re-fetch PvD Additional
   Information unless one of the following conditions occurs:

   *  The current time is beyond the "expires" value defined in
      Section 4.3 of [PVDDATA]

   *  A new Sequence Number for that PvD is received in a Router
      Advertisement (RA)

   To avoid synchronized queries toward the server hosting the PvD
   Additional Information when an object expires, clients MUST apply a
   randomized backoff as specified in Section 4.1 of [PVDDATA].

   For example, a client would issue the following request for the PvD
   associated with "https://proxy.example.org/
   masque{?target_host,target_port}":

   :method = GET
   :scheme = https
   :authority = proxy.example.org
   :path = /.well-known/pvd
   accept = application/pvd+json

   A client would send the same request as above for the PvD assocated
   with an HTTP CONNECT proxy on "proxy.example.org:8080".  Note that
   the client will not make a request to port 8080, but to port 443.

   Note that all proxies that are co-located on the same host share the
   same PvD Additional Information.  Proxy deployments that need
   separate PvD configuration properties SHOULD use different hosts.

   PvD Additional Information is required to contain the "identifier",
   "expires", and "prefixes" keys.  For proxy PvDs as defined in this
   document, the "identifier" MUST match the hostname of the HTTP proxy.
   The "prefixes" array SHOULD be empty by default.

2.1.  Discovery via HTTPS/SVCB Records

   To allow clients to determine whether PvD Additional Information is
   available for a given proxy, this document defines a new SvcParamKey
   in HTTPS and SVCB DNS records defined in [SVCB-DNS].

   Presence of this SvcParamKey, named pvd indicates that the proxy host
   supports PvD discovery via the well-known PvD URI ".well-known/pvd"
   defined in Section 4.1 of [PVDDATA].  The presence of this key in an
   HTTPS or SVCB record signals that the proxy's PvD Additional
   Information can be fetched using the "https" scheme from the proxy
   host on port 443 using the well-known path.  The presentation and
   wire-format values for pvd SvcParamKey MUST be empty.

   A client receiving a DNS record like the following:

   proxy.example.org. 3600 IN HTTPS 1 . alpn="h3,h2" pvd

   can interpret the presence of the pvd key as an indication that it
   MAY perform a PvD fetch from "https://proxy.example.org/.well-known/
   pvd" using HTTP GET method.

   While this key is particularly useful for detecting proxy
   configurations when looking up a DNS record for a known proxy name,
   this key generically provides a hint that PvD Additional Information
   is available, and can be used for use cases unrelated to proxies.
   This marker is advisory; clients MAY still attempt to fetch PvD
   Additional Information even if pvd SvcParamKey is not present.

   The pvd SvcParamKey is registered with IANA as described in
   Section 7.5.

3.  Enumerating proxies within a PvD

   This document defines a new PvD Additional Information key, proxies,
   that is an array of dictionaries, where each dictionary in the array
   defines a single proxy that is available as part of the PvD (see
   Section 7.1).  Each proxy is defined by a proxy protocol and a proxy
   location (i.e., a hostname and port or a URI template [URITEMPLATE]),
   along with other optional keys.

   When a PvD that contains the proxies key is fetched from a known
   proxy using the method described in Section 2, the proxies array
   describes equivalent proxies (potentially supporting other protocols)
   that can be used in addition to the known proxy.

   Such cases are useful for informing clients of related proxies as a
   discovery method, with the assumption that the client already is
   aware of one proxy.  Many historical methods of configuring a proxy
   only allow configuring a single FQDN hostname for the proxy.  A
   client can attempt to fetch the PvD information from the well-known
   URI to learn the list of complete URIs that support non-default
   protocols, such as [CONNECT-UDP] and [CONNECT-IP].

3.1.  Proxy definition keys

   This document defines two required keys for the sub-dictionaries in
   the proxies array: protocol and proxy.  There are also optional keys,
   including mandatory, alpn, and identifier.  Other optional keys can
   be added to the dictionary to further define or restrict the use of a
   proxy.  The keys are registered with IANA as described in
   Section 7.2, with the initial content provided below.

       Table 1: Initial Proxy Information PvD Keys Registry Contents

   The values for the protocol key are defined in the proxy protocol
   registry (Section 7.3), with the initial contents provided below.
   For consistency, any new proxy types that use HTTP Upgrade Tokens
   (and use the :protocol pseudo-header) SHOULD define the protocol
   value to match the Upgrade Token / :protocol value.  Extensions to
   proxy types that use the same HTTP Upgrade Tokens ought to be covered
   by the same protocol value; if there are properties specific to an
   extension, the extensions can either define new optional keys or rely
   on negotation within the protocol to discover support.

           Table 2: Initial PvD Proxy Protocol Registry Contents

   The value of proxy depends on the Proxy Location Format defined by
   proxy protocol.  The types defined here either use a host as defined
   in Section 3.2.2 of [URI] and port, or a full URI template.

   The value of the mandatory key is an array of keys that the client
   must understand and process to be able to use the proxy.  A client
   that does not understand a key from the array or cannot fully process
   the value of a key from the array MUST ignore the entire proxy
   definition.

   The mandatory array can contain keys that are either:

   *  registered in an IANA registry, defined in Section 7.2 and marked
      as optional;

   *  or proprietary, as defined in Section 3.2

   The mandatory array MUST NOT include any entries that are not present
   in the sub-dictionary.

   If the alpn key is present, it provides a hint for the Application-
   Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) [ALPN] protocol identifiers
   associated with this server.  For HTTP proxies, this can indicate if
   the proxy supports HTTP/3, HTTP/2, etc.

   The value of identifier key is a string that can be used to refer to
   a particular proxy from other dictionaries, specifically those
   defined in Section 4.  The string value is an arbitrary non-empty
   JSON string using UTF-8 encoding as discussed in Section 8.1 of
   [JSON].  Characters that need to be escaped in JSON strings per
   Section 7 of [JSON] are NOT RECOMMENDED as they can lead to
   difficulties in string comparisions as discussed in Section 8.3 of
   [JSON].  Identifier values MAY be duplicated across different proxy
   dictionaries in the proxies array.  References to a particular
   identifier apply to the set of proxies sharing that identifier.
   Proxies without the identifier key are expected to accept any traffic
   since their destinations cannot be contained in proxy-match array
   defined in Section 4.  Proxies with identifier keys are expected to
   accept only traffic matching rules in the proxy-match array and
   SHOULD NOT be used if they are not included in the proxy-match array.

3.2.  Proprietary keys in proxy configurations

   Implementations MAY include proprietary or vendor-specific keys in
   the sub-dictionaries of the proxies array to convey additional proxy
   configuration information not defined in this specification.

   A proprietary key MUST contain at least one underscore character
   ("_").  The last underscore serves as a separator between a vendor-
   specific namespace and the key name.  For example,
   "acme_tech_authmode" could be a proprietary key indicating an
   authentication mode defined by a vendor named "acme_tech".

   When combined with mandatory array, this mechanism allows
   implementations to extend proxy metadata while maintaining
   interoperability and ensuring safe fallback behavior for clients that
   do not support a given extension.

3.3.  Example

   Given a known HTTP CONNECT proxy FQDN, "proxy.example.org", a client
   could request PvD Additional Information with the following request:

   :method = GET
   :scheme = https
   :authority = proxy.example.org
   :path = /.well-known/pvd
   accept = application/pvd+json

   If the proxy has a PvD definition for this FQDN, it would return the
   following response to indicate a PvD that has two related proxy URIs.

:status = 200
content-type = application/pvd+json
content-length = 322

{
  "identifier": "proxy.example.org.",
  "expires": "2023-06-23T06:00:00Z",
  "prefixes": [],
  "proxies": [
    {
      "protocol": "http-connect",
      "proxy": "proxy.example.org:80"
    },
    {
      "protocol": "connect-udp",
      "proxy": "https://proxy.example.org/masque{?target_host,target_port}"
    }
  ]
}

   From this response, the client would learn the URI template of the
   proxy that supports UDP using [CONNECT-UDP], at
   "https://proxy.example.org/masque{?target_host,target_port}".

4.  Destination accessibility information for proxies

   Destination accessibility information is used when only a subset of
   destinations is reachable through a proxy.  Destination restrictions
   are often used in VPN tunnel configurations such as split DNS in
   IKEv2 [IKEV2SPLIT], and in other proxy configuration mechanisms like
   PAC files (see Section 1.1).

   PvD Additional Information can be used to indicate that a set of
   proxies only allows access to a limited set of destinations.

   To support determining which traffic is supported by different
   proxies, this document defines a new PvD Additional Information key
   proxy-match.  This key has a value that is an array of dictionaries,
   where each subdictionary describes a rule for matching traffic to one
   or more proxies, or excluding the traffic from all proxies described
   in the PvD.  These subdictionaries are referred to as "destination
   rules", since they define rules about which destinations can be
   accessed for a particular proxy or set of proxies.

4.1.  Destination Rule Keys

   This document defines four keys for destination rules.  Any
   destination rule MUST contain the proxies key.  Values corresponding
   to the proxies key may be either an empty array, which implies that
   no proxy defined in this PvD can process matching traffic, or an
   array of strings with at least one proxy identifier string.  All
   destination rules MUST also contain at least one other key use to
   describe the destination properties.  Each key MUST correspond to an
   array with at least one entry.

   Extensions or proprietary deployments can define new keys to describe
   destination properties.  Any destination rules that include keys not
   known to the client, or values that cannot be parsed, MUST be ignored
   in their entirety.

   Destination rule keys are registered with IANA as defined in
   Section 7.4, with the initial content provided below.

      Table 3: Initial PvD Proxy Destination Rule Registry Contents

   The domains array includes specific FQDNs and zones that are either
   accessible using specific proxy (for rules with non-empty proxies
   array) or non-accessible through any proxies (for rules with empty
   proxies array).  Wildcards are allowed only as prefixes (*.).  A
   wildcard prefix is used to indicate matching entire domains or
   subdomains instead of specific hostnames.  Note that this can be used
   to match multiple levels of subdomains.  For example "*.example.com"
   matches "internal.example.com" as well as "www.public.example.com".
   Entries that include the wildcard prefix also MUST be treated as if
   they match an FQDN that only contains the string after the prefix,
   with no subdomain.  So, an entry "*.example.com" in the domains array
   of a proxy-match rule would match the FQDN "example.com".  This is
   done to prevent commonly needing to include both "*.example.com" and
   "example.com" in the domains array of a proxy-match rule.  Matches
   are performed against absolute domain names, independent of the
   client's configured DNS search suffixes.  Clients MUST NOT apply
   local DNS suffix search rules when interpreting domains entries.  A
   trailing dot (".") at the end of a domain name is not required; the
   matching logic is the same regardless of its presence or absence.

   The subnets array includes IPv4 and IPv6 address literals, as well as
   IPv4 and IPv6 address subnets written using CIDR notation [CIDR].
   Subnet-based destination information can apply to cases where
   applications are communicating directly with an IP address (without
   having resolved a DNS name) as well as cases where an application
   resolved a DNS name to a set of IP addresses.  Note that if
   destination rules includes an empty proxies array (indicating that no
   proxy is applicable for this subnet), an application can only
   reliably follow this destination rule if it resolves DNS names prior
   to proxying.

   The ports array includes specific ports (used for matching TCP and/or
   UDP ports), as well as ranges of ports written with a low port value
   and a high port value, with a - in between.  For example, "1024-2048"
   matches all ports from 1024 to 2048, including the 1024 and 2048.  If
   ports key is not present, all ports are assumed to match.  The array
   may contain individual port numbers (such as "80") or inclusive
   ranges of ports.  For example "1024-2048" matches all ports from 1024
   to 2048, including the 1024 and 2048.

4.2.  Using Destination Rules

   The destination rules can be used to determine which traffic can be
   sent through proxies, and which specific set of proxies to use for
   any particular connection.  By evaluating the rules in order, a
   consistent behavior for usage can be achieved.

   Rules in the proxy-match array are provided in order of priority,
   such that a client can evaluate the rules from the first in the array
   to the last in the array, and attempt using the matching proxy or
   proxies from the earliest matching rule first.  If earliest matching
   rule has empty array of proxies client SHOULD NOT send matching
   traffic to any proxy defined in this PvD.

   In order to match a destination rule in the proxy-match array, all
   properties MUST apply.  For example, if a destination rule includes a
   domains array and a ports array, traffic that matches the rule needs
   to match at least one of the entries in the domains array and one of
   the entries in the ports array.  In addition, a destination rule is
   considered a match only if at least one of the associated proxy
   identifiers supports the protocol required by the connection attempt
   (for example, connect-udp for UDP traffic).  If no listed proxy
   identifier is applicable to the protocol, the rule MUST be treated as
   not matching, and the client continues evaluation of subsequent
   rules.

   A matched rule will then either point to one or more proxy identifier
   values, which correspond to proxies defined in the array from
   Section 3, or instructs the client to not send the matching traffic
   to any proxy.  If a matching rule contains more then one identifier
   the client should treat the array as an ordered list, where the first
   identifier is the most preferred.  Multiple proxy dictionaries can
   contain the same identifier value.  In this case, the client can
   choose any of the proxies; however, the client ought to prefer using
   the same proxy for the consecutive requests to the same proxy
   identifier to increase connection reuse.

   Entries listed in a proxy-match object MUST NOT expand the set of
   destinations that a client is willing to send to a particular proxy.
   The array can only narrow the set of destinations that the client is
   willing to send through the proxy.  For example, if the client has a
   local policy to only send requests for "*.example.com" to a proxy
   "proxy.example.com", and domains array of a match object contains
   "internal.example.com" and "other.company.com", the client would end
   up only proxying "internal.example.com" through the proxy.

4.3.  Proprietary Keys in Destination Rules

   Implementations MAY include proprietary or vendor-specific keys in
   destination rules to define custom matching logic not specified in
   this document.

   Similar to proprietary keys in proxy definitions (Section 3.2), a
   proprietary key in destination rule MUST contain at least one
   underscore character ("_"), which separates a vendor-specific
   namespace from the key name.  For example, "acme_processid" could be
   a key used to apply rules only to traffic of a specific process
   identifier as defined by a vendor named "acme".

   Clients that encounter a proprietary key they do not recognize MUST
   ignore the entire destination rule in which the key appears.  This
   ensures that unknown or unsupported matching logic does not
   inadvertently influence proxy selection or bypass security controls.
   This handling applies uniformly across all match rules, including
   fallback rules.

4.4.  Examples

   In the following example, two proxies are defined with a common
   identifier ("default_proxy"), with a single destination rule for
   "*.internal.example.org".

   {
     "identifier": "proxy.example.org.",
     "expires": "2023-06-23T06:00:00Z",
     "prefixes": [],
     "proxies": [
       {
         "protocol": "http-connect",
         "proxy": "proxy.example.org:80",
         "identifier": "default_proxy"
       },
       {
         "protocol": "http-connect",
         "proxy": "proxy2.example.org:80",
         "identifier": "default_proxy"
       }
     ],
     "proxy-match": [
       {
         "domains": [ "*.internal.example.org" ],
         "proxies": [ "default_proxy" ]
       }
     ]
   }

   The client could then choose to use either proxy associated with the
   "default_proxy" identifier for accessing TCP hosts that fall within
   the "*.internal.example.org" zone.  This would include the hostnames
   "internal.example.org", "foo.internal.example.org",
   "www.bar.internal.example.org" and all other hosts within
   "internal.example.org".  The client will use the same proxy for the
   following requests to hosts falling into the "*.internal.example.org"
   zone to increase connection reuse and make use of the connection
   resumption.  The client will not use the proxies defined in this
   configuration to hosts outside of the "*.internal.example.org" zone.

   In the next example, two proxies are defined with a separate
   identifiers, and there are three destination rules:

   {
     "identifier": "proxy.example.org.",
     "expires": "2023-06-23T06:00:00Z",
     "prefixes": [],
     "proxies": [
       {
         "protocol": "http-connect",
         "proxy": "proxy.example.org:80",
         "identifier": "default_proxy"
       },
       {
         "protocol": "http-connect",
         "proxy": "special-proxy.example.org:80",
         "identifier": "special_proxy"
       }
     ],
     "proxy-match": [
       {
         "domains": [ "*.special.example.org" ],
         "ports": [ "80", "443", "49152-65535" ],
         "proxies": [ "special_proxy" ]
       },
       {
         "domains": [ "no-proxy.internal.example.org" ],
         "proxies": [ ]
       },
       {
         "domains": [ "*.internal.example.org" ],
         "proxies": [ "default_proxy" ]
       }
     ]
   }

   In this case, the client would use "special-proxy.example.org:80" for
   any TCP traffic that matches "*.special.example.org" destined to
   ports 80, 443 or any port between 49152 and 65535.  The client would
   not use any of the defined proxies for access to "no-
   proxy.internal.example.org".  And finally, the client would use
   "proxy.example.org:80" to access any other TCP traffic that matches
   "*.internal.example.org".

   In the following example, three proxies are sharing a common
   identifier ("default-proxy"), but use separate protocols constraining
   the traffic that they can process.

{
  "identifier": "proxy.example.org.",
  "expires": "2023-06-23T06:00:00Z",
  "prefixes": [],
  "proxies": [
    {
      "protocol": "http-connect",
      "proxy": "proxy.example.org:80",
      "identifier": "default_proxy"
    },
    {
      "protocol": "connect-udp",
      "proxy": "https://proxy.example.org/masque/udp/{target_host},{target_port}",
      "identifier": "default_proxy"
    },
    {
      "protocol": "connect-ip",
      "proxy": "https://proxy.example.org/masque/ip{?target,ipproto}",
      "identifier": "default_proxy"
    }
  ],
  "proxy-match": [
    {
      "domains": [ "*.internal.example.org" ],
      "proxies": [ "default_proxy" ]
    }
  ]
}

   The client would use proxies in the following way:

   *  Traffic not destined to hosts within the "*.internal.example.org"
      zone is not sent to any proxy defined in this configuration

   *  TCP traffic destined to hosts within the "*.internal.example.org"
      zone is sent either to the proxy with "http-connect" protocol or
      to the proxy with "connect-ip" protocol

   *  UDP traffic destined to hosts within the "*.internal.example.org"
      zone is sent either to the proxy with "connect-udp" protocol or to
      the proxy with "connect-ip" protocol

   *  Traffic other than TCP and UDP destined to hosts within the
      "*.internal.example.org" zone is sent to the proxy with "connect-
      ip" protocol

   The following example provides a configuration of proxies to be used
   by default with a set with exceptions to bypass:

   {
     "identifier": "proxy.example.org.",
     "expires": "2023-06-23T06:00:00Z",
     "prefixes": [],
     "proxies": [
       {
         "protocol": "http-connect",
         "proxy": "proxy.example.org:80",
         "identifier": "default_proxy"
       },
       {
         "protocol": "http-connect",
         "proxy": "backup.example.org:80",
         "identifier": "secondary_proxy"
       }
     ],
     "proxy-match": [
       {
         "domains": [ "*.intranet.example.org" ],
         "proxies": [ ]
       },
       {
         "subnets": [ "192.0.2.0/24", "2001:DB8::/32" ],
         "proxies": [ ]
       },
       {
         "proxies": [ "default_proxy", "secondary_proxy" ]
       }
     ]
   }

   In this case, the client will not forward TCP traffic that is
   destined to hosts matching "*.intranet.example.org", 192.0.2.0/24 or
   2001:DB8::/32, through the proxies.  Due to the order in "proxies"
   array in the last rule of "proxy-match", the client would prefer
   "proxy.example.org:80" over "backup.example.org:80"

5.  Discovering proxies from network PvDs

   [PVDDATA] defines how PvD Additional Information is discovered based
   on network advertisements using Router Advertisements [RFC4861].  A
   network defining its configuration via PvD information can include
   the proxies key (Section 3) to inform clients of a list of proxies
   available on the network.

   This association of proxies with the network's PvD can be used as a
   mechanism to discover proxies, as an alternative to PAC files.
   However, client systems MUST NOT automatically send traffic over
   proxies advertised in this way without explicit configuration,
   policy, or user permission.  For example, a client can use this
   mechanism to choose between known proxies, such as if the client was
   already proxying traffic and has multiple options to choose between.

   Further security and experience considerations are needed for these
   cases.

6.  Security Considerations

   The mechanisms in this document allow clients using a proxy to
   "upgrade" a configuration for a cleartext HTTP/1.1 or SOCKS proxy
   into a configuration that uses TLS to communication to the proxy.
   This upgrade can add protection to the proxied traffic so it is less
   observable by entities along the network path; however it does not
   prevent the proxy itself from observing the traffic being proxied.

   Configuration advertised via PvD Additional Information, such DNS
   zones or associated proxies, can only be safely used when fetched
   over a secure TLS-protected connection, and the client has validated
   that that the hostname of the proxy, the identifier of the PvD, and
   the validated hostname identity on the certificate all match.

   When using information in destination rules (Section 4), clients MUST
   only allow the PvD configuration to narrow the scope of traffic that
   they will send through a proxy.  Clients that are configured by
   policy to only send a particular set of traffic through a particular
   proxy can learn about rules that will cause them to send more
   narrowly-scoped traffic, but MUST NOT send traffic that would go
   beyond what is allowed by local policy.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  New PvD Additional Information key

   This document registers two new keys in the "Additional Information
   PvD Keys" registry.

7.1.1.  proxies Key

   JSON Key: proxies

   Description: Array of proxy dictionaries associated with this PvD

   Type: Array of dictionaries

   Example:

 [
  {
   "protocol": "connect-udp",
   "proxy": "https://proxy.example.org/masque{?target_host,target_port}"
  }
 ]

7.1.2.  proxy-match Key

   JSON Key: proxy-match

   Description: Array of proxy match rules, as dictionaries, associated
   with entries in the proxies array.

   Type: Array of dictionaries

   Example:

   [
    {
     "domains": [ "*.internal.example.org" ],
     "proxies": [ "default_proxy" ]
    }
   ]

7.2.  New PvD Proxy Information Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new registry "Proxy Information PvD
   Keys", within the "Provisioning Domains (PvDs)" registry page.  This
   new registry reserves JSON keys for use in sub-dictionaries under the
   proxies key.  The initial contents of this registry are given in
   Table 1.

   New assignments in the "Proxy Information PvD Keys" registry will be
   administered by IANA through Expert Review [RFC8126].  Experts are
   requested to ensure that defined keys do not overlap in names or
   semantics, do not contain an underscore character ("_") in the names
   (since underscores are reserved for vendor-specific keys), and have
   clear format definitions.  The reference and notes fields MAY be
   empty.

7.3.  New PvD Proxy Protocol Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new registry "Proxy Protocol PvD
   Values", within the "Provisioning Domains (PvDs)" registry page.
   This new registry reserves JSON values for the protocol key in
   proxies sub-dictionaries.  The initial contents of this registry are
   given in Table 2.

   New assignments in the "Proxy Protocol PvD Values" registry will be
   administered by IANA through Expert Review [RFC8126].  Experts are
   requested to ensure that defined keys do not overlap in names.  The
   reference and notes fields MAY be empty.

7.4.  New PvD Proxy Destination Rule Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new registry "Proxy Destination Rule
   PvD Keys", within the "Provisioning Domains (PvDs)" registry page.
   This new registry reserves JSON keys for use in sub-dictionaries
   under the proxy-match key.  The initial contents of this registry are
   given in Table 3.

   New assignments in the "Proxy Destination Rule PvD Keys" registry
   will be administered by IANA through Expert Review [RFC8126].
   Experts are requested to ensure that defined keys do not overlap in
   names or semantics, and do not contain an underscore character ("_")
   in the names (since underscores are reserved for vendor-specific
   keys).

7.5.  New DNS SVCB Service Parameter Key (SvcParamKey)

   IANA is requested to add a new entry to the "DNS SVCB Service
   Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys)" registry:

   *  Number: TBD

   *  Name: pvd

   *  Meaning: PvD configuration is available at the well-known path

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Reference: this document, Section 2.1
