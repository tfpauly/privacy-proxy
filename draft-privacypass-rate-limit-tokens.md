# Introduction

This document specifies a variant of the Privacy Pass issuance protocol
(as defined in {{!ARCH=I-D.ietf-privacypass-architecture}}) that allows
for tokens to be rate-limited on a per-origin basis. This enables origins
to use tokens for use cases that need to restrict access from anonymous clients.

The base Privacy Pass issuance protocol {{!ISSUANCE=I-D.ietf-privacypass-protocol}}
defines stateless anonymous tokens, which can either be publicly verifiable
or not.

This variant build upon the publicly verifiable issuance protocol that uses
RSA Blind Signatures {{!BLINDSIG=I-D.irtf-cfrg-rsa-blind-signatures}}, and
allows tokens to be rate-limited on a per-origin basis. This means that
a client will only be able to receive a limited number of tokens associated
with a given origin server within a fixed period of time.

This issuance protocol registers the Rate-Limited Blind RSA token type
({{iana-token-type}}), to be used with the PrivateToken HTTP authentication
scheme defined in {{!AUTHSCHEME=I-D.ietf-privacypass-auth-scheme}}.

## Motivation

A client that wishes to keep its IP address private can hide its IP address
using a proxy service or a VPN. However, doing so severely limits the client's
ability to access services and content, since servers might not be able to
enforce their policies without a stable and unique client identifier.

Privacy Pass tokens in general allow clients to provide anonymous attestation
of various properties. The tokens generated by the base issuance
protocol ({{ISSUANCE}}) can be used to verify that a client meets a particular
bar for attestation, but cannot be used by a redeeming server to rate-limit
specific clients.

There are several common use cases for rate-limiting anonymous clients that
are common on the Internet. These routinely use client IP address tracking,
among other characteristics, to implement rate-limiting.

One example of this use case is rate-limiting website accesses to a client to
help prevent fraud. Operations that are sensitive to fraud, such as account
creation on a website or logging into an account, often employ rate-limiting
as a defense-in-depth strategy. Additional verification can be required by these
pages when a client exceeds a set rate-limit.

Another example of this use case is a metered paywall, where an origin limits the
number of page requests from each unique user over a period of time before the
user is required to pay for access. The origin typically resets this state
periodically, say, once per month. For example, an origin may serve ten (major
content) requests in a month before a paywall is enacted. Origins may want to
differentiate quick refreshes from distinct accesses.

## Properties and Requirements {#properties}

For rate-limited token issuance, the Attester, Issuer, and Origin as defined in
{{ARCH}} each have partial knowledge of the Client's identity and actions,
and each entity only knows enough to serve its function (see {{terms}} for more
about the pieces of information):

- The Attester knows the Client's identity and learns the Client's public key
  (Client Key), the Issuer being targeted (Issuer Name), the period of time
  for which the Issuer's policy is valid (Issuer Policy Window), the number of
  tokens the Issuer is willing to issue within the current policy window, and the
  number of tokens issued to a given Client for the claimed Origin in the policy
  window. The Attester does not know the identity of the Origin the Client is
  trying to access (Origin Name), but knows a Client-anonymized identifier for
  it (Anonymous Origin ID).

- The Issuer knows the Origin's secret (Issuer Origin Secret) and policy about client
  access, and learns the Origin's identity (Origin Name) during issuance. The Issuer
  does not learn the Client's identity or information about the Client's access
  pattern.

- The Origin knows the Issuer to which it will delegate an incoming Client
  (Issuer Name), and can verify that any tokens presented by the Client were
  signed by the Issuer. The Origin does not learn which Attester was used by a
  Client for issuance.

Since an Issuer enforces policies on behalf of Origins, a Client is required to
reveal the Origin's identity to the delegated Issuer. It is a requirement of
this protocol that the Attester not learn the Origin's identity so that,
despite knowing the Client's identity, an Attester cannot track and concentrate
information about Client activity.

An Issuer expects an Attester to verify its Clients' identities correctly, but an
Issuer cannot confirm an Attester's efficacy or the Attester-Client relationship
directly without learning the Client's identity. Similarly, an Origin does not
know the Attester's identity, but ultimately relies on the Attester to correctly
verify or authenticate a Client for the Origin's policies to be correctly
enforced. An Issuer therefore chooses to issue tokens to only known and
reputable Attesters; the Issuer can employ its own methods to determine the
reputation of a Attester.

An Attester is expected to employ a stable Client identifier, such as an IP
address, a device identifier, or an account at the Attester, that can serve as a
reasonable proxy for a user with some creation and maintenance cost on the user.

For the Issuance protocol, a Client is expected to create and maintain stable
and explicit secrets for time periods that are on the scale of Issuer policy
windows. Changing these secrets arbitrarily during a policy window can result in
token issuance failure for the rest of the policy window; see {{client-state}}
for more details. A Client can use a service offered by its Attester or a
third-party to store these secrets, but it is a requirement of this protocol
that the Attester not be able to learn these secrets.

The privacy guarantees of this issuance protocol, specifically those around
separating the identity of the Client from the names of the Origins that it
accesses, are based on the expectation that there is not collusion between
the entities that know about Client identity and those that know about Origin
identity. Clients choose and share information with Attesters, and Origins
choose and share policy with Issuers; however, the Attester is generally
expected to not be colluding with Issuers or Origins. If this occurs, it
can become possible for an Attester to learn or infer which Origins a
Client is accessing, or for an Origin to learn or infer the Client
identity. For further discussion, see {{collusion}}.

# Terminology {#terms}

{::boilerplate bcp14}

Unless otherwise specified, this document encodes protocol messages in TLS notation
from {{!TLS13=RFC8446}}, Section 3.

This draft includes pseudocode that uses the functions and conventions defined
in {{!HPKE=I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}.

Encoding an integer to a sequence of bytes in network byte order is described
using the function "encode(n, v)", where "n" is the number of bytes and "v" is
the integer value. The function "len()" returns the length of a sequence of bytes.

The following terms are defined in {{ARCH}} and are used throughout this
document:

- Client: An entity that provides authorization tokens to services
  across the Internet, in return for authorization.
- Issuer: An entity that produces Privacy Pass tokens to clients.
- Attester: An entity that can attest to properties about the client,
including previous patterns of access.
- Origin: The server from which the client can redeem tokens.
- Issuance Protocol: The protocol exchange that involves the client,
attester, and issuer, used to generate tokens.

The following terms are defined in {{AUTHSCHEME}}, which defines the
interactions between clients and origins:

- Issuer Name: The name that identifies the Issuer, which is an entity
that can generate tokens for a Client using one or more issuance protocols.
- Token Key: Keying material that can be used with an issuance protocol
to create a signed token.
- Origin Name: The name that identifies the Origin, as included in a
TokenChallenge.

Additionally, this document defines several terms that are unique to the
rate-limited issuance protocol:

- Issuer Policy Window: The period over which an Issuer will track access
policy, defined in terms of seconds and represented as a uint64. The state
that the Attester keeps for a Client is specific to a policy window.
The effective policy window for a specific Client starts when the Client
first sends a request associated with an Issuer.

- Origin Name Key: The public key used to encrypt values such as
Origin Name in requests from Clients to the Issuer, so that Attesters cannot learn
the Origin Name value. Each Origin Name Key is used across all requests on the
Issuer, for different Origins.

- Anonymous Origin ID: An identifier that is generated by the Client and marked
on requests to the Attester, which represents a specific Origin anonymously. The Client
generates a stable Anonymous Origin ID for each Origin Name, to allow the Attester
to count token access without learning the Origin Name.

- Client Key: A public key chosen by the Client and shared only with the Attester;
  see {{issuance-unlinkability}} for more details about this restriction.

- Client Secret: The secret key used by the Client during token issuance, whose public key
(Client Key) is shared with the Attester.

- Issuer Origin Secret: A per-origin secret key used by the Issuer during token issuance,
whose public key is not shared with anyone.

- Anonymous Issuer Origin ID: An identifier that is generated by Issuer based on an
Issuer Origin Secret that is per-Client and per-Origin. See {{response-two}} for details
of derivation.

# Configuration {#setup}

Issuers MUST provide three parameters for configuration:

1. Issuer Policy Window: a uint64 of seconds as defined in {{terms}}.
1. Issuer Request URI: a token request URL for generating access tokens.
   For example, an Issuer URL might be https://issuer.example.net/token-request. This parameter
   uses resource media type "text/plain".
1. Origin Name Key: a `NameKey` structure as defined below to use when encrypting the Origin
   Name in issuance requests. This parameter uses resource media type "application/issuer-name-key".
   The Npk parameter corresponding to the HpkeKdfId can be found in {{HPKE}}.

~~~
opaque HpkePublicKey[Npk]; // defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
uint16 HpkeKemId;          // defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
uint16 HpkeKdfId;          // defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
uint16 HpkeAeadId;         // defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke

struct {
  uint8 key_id;
  HpkeKemId kem_id;
  HpkePublicKey public_key;
  HpkeKdfId kdf_id;
  HpkeAeadId aead_id;
} NameKey;
~~~

The Issuer parameters can be obtained from an Issuer via a directory object, which is a JSON
object whose field names and values are raw values and URLs for the parameters.

| Field Name           | Value                                            |
|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| issuer-policy-window | Issuer Policy Window as a JSON number            |
| issuer-request-uri   | Issuer Request URI resource URL as a JSON string |
| origin-name-key-uri  | Origin Name Key URI resource URL as a JSON string |

As an example, the Issuer's JSON directory could look like:

~~~
 {
    "issuer-token-window": 86400,
    "issuer-request-uri": "https://issuer.example.net/token-request"
    "origin-name-key-uri": "https://issuer.example.net/name-key",
 }
~~~

Issuer directory resources have the media type "application/json"
and are located at the well-known location /.well-known/token-issuer-directory.

# Token Challenge Requirements

Clients receive challenges for tokens, as described in {{AUTHSCHEME}}.

For the rate-limited token issuance protocol described in this document,
the token challenge MUST be interactive and per-origin. That is, the
TokenChallenge structure MUST contain both the redemption_nonce and
origin_name fields.

The HTTP authentication challenge also SHOULD contain the following
additional attribute:

- "origin-name-key", which contains a base64url encoding of a `NameKey` as defined
in {{setup}} to use when encrypting the Origin Name in issuance requests.

# Issuance Protocol {#issuance}

This section describes the Issuance protocol for a Client to request and receive
a token from an Issuer. Token issuance involves a Client, Attester, and Issuer,
with the following steps:

1. The Client sends a token request containing a token request, encrypted origin
name, and one-time-use public key and signature to the Attester

1. The Attester validates the request contents, specifically checking the request
signature, and proxies the request to the Issuer

1. The Issuer validates the request against the signature, and processes its contents,
and produces a token response sent back to the Attester

1. The Attester verifies the response and proxies the response to the Client

The Issuance protocol is designed such that Client, Attester, and Issuer learn only
what is necessary for completing the protocol; see {{info-disclosure}} for more details.

The Issuance protocol has a number of underlying cryptographic dependencies for
operation:

- RSA Blind Signatures {{BLINDSIG}}, for issuing and constructing Tokens. This support
is the same as used in the base publicly verifiable token issuance protocol {{ISSUANCE}}

- {{HPKE}}, for encrypting the origin server name in transit between Client and Issuer across the Attester.

- {{ECDSA}} signatures with key blinding, as described in {{!KEYBLINDING=I-D.dew-cfrg-signature-key-blinding}}, for verifying
  correctness of Client requests.

Clients and Issuers are required to implement all of these dependencies, whereas Attesters are required
to implement ECDSA signature with key blinding support.

## State Requirements

The Issuance protocol requires each participating endpoint to maintain some
necessary state, as described in this section.

### Client State {#client-state}

A Client is required to have the following information, derived from a given TokenChallenge:

- Origin Name, a hostname referring to the Origin {{!RFC6454}}. This is
  the value of TokenChallenge.origin_name.
- Token Key, a blind signature public key corresponding to the Issuer
  identified by the TokenChallenge.issuer_name.
- Origin Name Key, a public key used to encrypt request information corresponding
  to the Issuer identified by TokenChallenge.issuer_name.

Clients maintain a stable Client Key that they use for all communication with
a specific Attester. Client Key is a public key, where the corresponding private key
Client Secret is known only to the client.

If the client loses this (Client Key, Client Secret), they may generate a new tuple. The
Attester will enforce if a client is allowed to use this new Client Key. See {{attester-state}}
for details on this enforcement.

Clients also need to be able to generate an Anonymous Origin ID value that corresponds
to the Origin Name, to send in requests to the Attester.

Anonymous Origin ID MUST be a stable and unpredictable 32-byte value computed by the Client.
Clients MUST NOT change this value across token requests for the same Origin Name. Doing
so will result in token issuance failure (specifically, when an Attester rejects a request
upon detecting two Anonymous Origin ID values that map to the same Origin).

One possible mechanism for implementing this identifier is for the Client to store a mapping
between the Origin Name and a randomly generated Anonymous Origin ID for future requests. Alternatively,
the Client can compute a PRF keyed by a per-client secret (Client Secret) over the Origin Name,
e.g., Anonymous Origin ID = HKDF(secret=Client Secret, salt="", info=Origin Name).

### Attester State {#attester-state}

An Attester is required to maintain state for every authenticated Client. The mechanism
of identifying a Client is specific to each Attester, and is not defined in this document.
As examples, the Attester could use device-specific certificates or account authentication
to identify a Client.

Attesters must enforce that Clients don't change their Client Key frequently, to ensure Clients can't
regularily evade the per-client policy as seen by the issuer. Attesters MUST NOT allow Clients to
change their Client Key more than once within a policy window, or in the subsequent policy window
after a previous Client Key change. Alternative schemes where the Attester stores the encrypted
(Client Key, Client Secret) tuple on behalf of the client are possble but not described here.

Attesters are expected to know the Issuer Policy Window for any Issuer Name to which
they allow access. This information can be retrieved using the URIs defined in {{setup}}.

For each Client-Issuer pair, an Attester maintains a policy window
start and end time for each Issuer from which a Client requests a token.

For each tuple of (Client Key, Anonymous Origin ID, policy window), the Attester maintains the
following state:

- A counter of successful tokens issued
- Whether or not a previous request was rejected by the Issuer
- The last received Anonymous Issuer Origin ID value for this Anonymous Origin ID, if any

### Issuer State {#issuer-state}

Issuers maintain a stable Issuer Origin Secret that they use in calculating values returned
to the Attester for each origin. If this value changes, it will open up a possibility
for Clients to request extra tokens for an Origin without being limited, within a
policy window. See {{token-key-management}} for details about generating and rotating
the Issuer Origin Secret.

Issuers are expected to have the private key that corresponds to Origin Name Key,
which allows them to decrypt the Origin Name values in requests.

Issuers also need to know the set of valid Token Key public keys and corresponding
private key, for each Origin Name that is served by the Issuer. Origins SHOULD update
their view of the Token Key regularly to ensure that Client requests do not fail
after Token Key rotation.

## Issuance HTTP Headers

The Issuance protocol defines four new HTTP headers that are used in requests
and responses between Clients, Attesters, and Issuers (see {{iana-headers}}).

The "Sec-Token-Origin" is an Item Structured Header {{!RFC8941}}. Its
value MUST be a Byte Sequence. This header is sent both on Client-to-Attester
requests ({{request-one}}) and on Issuer-to-Attester responses ({{response-one}}).
Its ABNF is:

~~~
    Sec-Token-Origin = sf-binary
~~~

The "Sec-Token-Client" is an Item Structured Header {{!RFC8941}}. Its
value MUST be a Byte Sequence. This header is sent on Client-to-Attester
requests ({{request-one}}), and contains the bytes of Client Key.
Its ABNF is:

~~~
    Sec-Token-Client = sf-binary
~~~

The "Sec-Token-Request-Blind" is an Item Structured Header {{!RFC8941}}. Its
value MUST be a Byte Sequence. This header is sent on Client-to-Attester
requests ({{request-one}}), and contains a per-request nonce value.
Its ABNF is:

~~~
    Sec-Token-Request-Blind = sf-binary
~~~

The "Sec-Token-Limit" is an Item Structured Header {{!RFC8941}}. Its
value MUST be an Integer. This header is sent on Issuer-to-Attester
responses ({{response-one}}), and contains the number of times a
Client can retrieve a token for the requested Origin within a policy window,
as set by the Issuer. Its ABNF is:

~~~
    Sec-Token-Limit = sf-integer
~~~

## Client-to-Attester Request {#request-one}

The Client and Attester MUST use a secure and Attester-authenticated HTTPS
connection. They MAY use mutual authentication or mechanisms such as TLS
certificate pinning, to mitigate the risk of channel compromise; see
{{sec-considerations}} for additional about this channel.

Requests to the Attester need to indicate the Issuer Name to which issuance
requests will be forwarded. Attesters SHOULD provide Clients with a URI template
that contains one variable that contains the Issuer Name, "issuer", using
Level 3 URI template encoding as defined in Section 1.2 of {{!RFC6570}}.

An example of an Attester URI templates is shown below:

~~~
https://attester.net/token-request{?issuer}
~~~

Attesters and Clients MAY agree on other mechanisms to specify the Issuer Name
in requests.

The Client first creates an issuance request message for a random value `nonce`
using the input TokenChallenge `challenge` and the Issuer key identifier `key_id`
as follows:

~~~
nonce = random(32)
context = SHA256(challenge)
token_input = concat(0x0003, nonce, context, key_id)
blinded_msg, blind_inv = rsabssa_blind(pkI, token_input)
~~~

The Client then uses Client Key to generate its one-time-use request public
key `request_key` and blind `request_blind` as described in {{client-anon-issuer-origin-id}}.

The Client then encrypts the origin name using Origin Name Key, producing
`encrypted_origin_name` as described in {{encrypt-origin}}.

Finally, the Client uses Client Secret to produce `request_signature`
as described in {{index-proof}}.

The Client then constructs a TokenRequest structure. This TokenRequest
structure is based on the publicly verifiable token issuance path in
{{ISSUANCE}}, adding fields for the encrypted origin name and request signature.

~~~
struct {
   uint16_t token_type = 0x0003;
   uint8_t token_key_id;
   uint8_t blinded_msg[Nk];
   uint8_t request_key[49];
   uint8_t name_key_id[32];
   uint8_t encrypted_origin_name<1..2^16-1>;
   uint8_t request_signature[96];
} TokenRequest;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "token_type" is a 2-octet integer, which matches the type in the challenge.

- "token_key_id" is the least significant byte of the Token Key key ID, which is
generated as SHA256(public_key), where public_key is a DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo
object carrying Token Key.

- "blinded_msg" is the Nk-octet request defined above.

- "request_key" is computed as described in {{index-request}}.

- "name_key_id" is a collision-resistant hash that identifies the Origin Name Key,
generated as SHA256(NameKey).

- "encrypted_origin_name" is an encrypted structure that contains Origin Name,
calculated as described in {{encrypt-origin}}.

- "request_signature" is computed as described in {{index-proof}}.

The Client then generates an HTTP POST request to send through the Attester to
the Issuer, with the TokenRequest as the body. The media type for this request
is "message/token-request". The Client includes the "Sec-Token-Origin" header,
whose value is Anonymous Origin ID; the "Sec-Token-Client" header, whose value is Client Key; and
the "Sec-Token-Request-Blind" header, whose value is request_blind. The Client
sends this request to the Attester's proxy URI. An example request is shown below,
where Nk = 512, the Issuer Name is "issuer.net", and the Attester URI template is
"https://attester.net/token-request{?issuer}"

~~~
:method = POST
:scheme = https
:authority = attester.net
:path = /token-request?issuer=issuer.net
accept = message/token-response
cache-control = no-cache, no-store
content-type = message/token-request
content-length = <Length of TokenRequest>
sec-token-origin = Anonymous Origin ID
sec-token-client = Client Key
sec-token-request-blind = request_blind

<Bytes containing the TokenRequest>
~~~

If the Attester detects a token_type in the TokenRequest that it does not recognize
or support, it MUST reject the request with an HTTP 400 error.

The Attester also checks to validate that the name_key_id in the client's TokenRequest
matches a known Origin Name Key public key for the Issuer. For example, the Attester can
fetch this key using the API defined in {{setup}}. This check is done to help ensure that
the Client has not been given a unique key that could allow the Issuer to fingerprint or target
the Client. If the key does not match, the Attester rejects the request with an HTTP
400 error. Note that this can lead to failures in the event of Issuer Origin Name Key
rotation; see {{privacy-considerations}} for considerations.

The Attester finally validates the Client's stable mapping request as described in
{{attester-anon-issuer-origin-id}}. If this fails, the Attester MUST return an HTTP 400
error to the Client.

If the Attester accepts the request, it will look up the state stored for this Client.
It will look up the count of previously generate tokens for this Client using the same
Anonymous Origin ID. See {{attester-state}} for more details.

If the Attester has stored state that a previous request for this Anonymous Origin ID was
rejected by the Issuer in the current policy window, it SHOULD reject the request without
forwarding it to the Issuer.

If the Attester detects this Client has changed their Client Key more frequently than allowed
as described in {{attester-state}}, it SHOULD reject the request without forwarding it to
the Issuer.

## Attester-to-Issuer Request {#request-two}

Assuming all checks in {{request-one}} succeed, the Attester generates an HTTP POST request
to send to the Issuer with the Client's TokenRequest as the body. The Attester MUST NOT
add information that will uniquely identify a Client, or associate the request with a small
set of possible Clients. Extensions to this protocol MAY allow Attesters to add information
that can be used to separate large populations, such as providing information about the country
or region to which a Client belongs. An example request is shown below.

~~~
:method = POST
:scheme = https
:authority = issuer.net
:path = /token-request
accept = message/token-response
cache-control = no-cache, no-store
content-type = message/token-request
content-length = <Length of TokenRequest>

<Bytes containing the TokenRequest>
~~~

The Attester and the Issuer MUST use a secure and Issuer-authenticated HTTPS
connection. Also, Issuers MUST authenticate Attesters, either via mutual
TLS or another form of application-layer authentication. They MAY additionally use
mechanisms such as TLS certificate pinning, to mitigate the risk of channel
compromise; see {{sec-considerations}} for additional about this channel.

Upon receipt of the forwarded request, the Issuer validates the following conditions:

- The TokenRequest contains a supported token_type
- The TokenRequest.token_key_id and TokenRequest.name_key_id correspond to known
Token Keys and Origin Name Keys held by the Issuer.
- The TokenRequest.encrypted_origin_name can be decrypted using the
Issuer's private key (the private key associated with Origin Name Key), and matches
an Origin Name that is served by the Issuer
- The TokenRequest.blinded_msg is of the correct size

If any of these conditions is not met, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 400 error to the Attester,
which will forward the error to the client.

The Issuer determines the correct Issuer Key by using the decrypted Origin Name value and
TokenRequest.token_key_id. If there is no Token Key whose truncated key ID matches
TokenRequest.token_key_id, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 401 error to Attester, which will
forward the error to the client. The Attester learns that the client's view of the Origin key
was invalid in the process.

## Issuer-to-Attester Response {#response-one}

If the Issuer is willing to give a token to the Client, the Issuer decrypts
TokenRequest.encrypted_origin_name to discover "origin". If this fails, the Issuer rejects
the request with a 400 error. Otherwise, the Issuer validates and processes the token request
with Issuer Origin Secret corresponding to the designated Origin as described in {{issuer-anon-issuer-origin-id}}.
If this fails, the Issuer rejects the request with a 400 error. Otherwise, the output is
index_key.

The Issuer completes the issuance flow by computing a blinded response as follows:

~~~
blind_sig = rsabssa_blind_sign(skP, TokenRequest.blinded_msg)
~~~

`skP` is the private key corresponding to Token Key, known only to the Issuer.

The Issuer generates an HTTP response with status code 200 whose body consists of
blind_sig, with the content type set as "message/token-response", the
index_key set in the "Sec-Token-Origin" header, and the limit of tokens
allowed for a Client for the Origin within a policy window set in the
"Sec-Token-Limit" header. This limit SHOULD NOT be unique to a specific
Origin, such that the Attester could use the value to infer which Origin
the Client is accessing (see {{privacy-considerations}}).

~~~
:status = 200
content-type = message/token-response
content-length = <Length of blind_sig>
sec-token-origin = index_key
sec-token-limit = Token limit

<Bytes containing the blind_sig>
~~~

## Attester-to-Client Response {#response-two}

Upon receipt of a successful response from the Issuer, the Attester extracts the
"Sec-Token-Origin" header, and uses the value to determine Anonymous Issuer Origin ID
as described in {{attester-output-anon-issuer-origin-id}}.

If the "Sec-Token-Origin" is missing, or if the same Anonymous Issuer Origin ID was previously
received in a response for a different Anonymous Origin ID within the same policy window,
the Attester MUST drop the token and respond to the client with an HTTP 400 status.
If there is not an error, the Anonymous Issuer Origin ID is stored alongside the state
for the Anonymous Origin ID.

The Attester also extracts the "Sec-Token-Limit" header, and compares the limit against the
previous count of accesses for this Client for the Anonymous Origin ID. If the count is greater
than or equal to the limit, the Attester drops the token and responds to the client with an
HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) error.

For all other cases, the Attester forwards all HTTP responses unmodified to the Client
as the response to the original request for this issuance.

When the Attester detects successful token issuance, it MUST increment the counter
in its state for the number of tokens issued to the Client for the Anonymous Origin ID.

Upon receipt, the Client handles the response and, if successful, processes the
body as follows:

~~~
authenticator = rsabssa_finalize(pkI, token_input, blind_sig, blind_inv)
~~~

If this succeeds, the Client then constructs a token as described in
{{AUTHSCHEME}} as follows:

~~~
struct {
    uint16_t token_type = 0x0003
    uint8_t nonce[32];
    uint8_t context[32];
    uint8_t token_key_id[Nid];
    uint8_t authenticator[Nk]
} Token;
~~~

# Encrypting Origin Names {#encrypt-origin}

Given a `NameKey` (Origin Name Key), Clients produce encrypted_origin_name and authenticate
the contents of the TokenRequest using the following values:

- the one octet key identifier from the Name Key, keyID, with the corresponding KEM identified by kemID,
the public key from the configuration, pkI, and;
- a selected combination of KDF, identified by kdfID, and AEAD, identified by aeadID.

Beyond the key configuration inputs, Clients also require the following inputs defined
in {{request-one}}: `token_key_id`, `blinded_msg`, `request_key`, and `name_key_id`.

Together, these are used to encapsulate Origin Name (`origin_name`) and produce
Encrypted Origin Name (`encrypted_origin`) as follows:

1. Compute an {{HPKE}} context using pkI, yielding context and encapsulation key enc.
1. Construct associated data, aad, by concatenating the values of keyID, kemID, kdfID,
   aeadID, and all other values of the TokenRequest structure.
1. Pad origin_name with N zero bytes, where N = 31 - ((L - 1) % 32) and L is the length
   of origin_name. Denote this padding process as the function `pad`.
1. Encrypt (seal) the padded origin_name with aad as associated data using context, yielding ciphertext ct.
1. Concatenate the values of aad, enc, and ct, yielding encrypted_origin_name.

Note that enc is of fixed-length, so there is no ambiguity in parsing this structure.

In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

~~~
enc, context = SetupBaseS(pkI, "TokenRequest")
aad = concat(encode(1, keyID),
             encode(2, kemID),
             encode(2, kdfID),
             encode(2, aeadID),
             encode(2, token_type),
             encode(1, token_key_id),
             encode(Nk, blinded_msg),
             encode(49, request_key),
             encode(32, name_key_id))
ct = context.Seal(aad, pad(origin_name))
encrypted_origin_name = concat(enc, ct)
~~~

Issuers reverse this procedure to recover the (padded) Origin Name by computing the AAD as
described above and decrypting encrypted_origin_name with their private key skI (the private
key corresponding to pkI), and stripping off padding bytes. In pseudocode, this procedure
is as follows:

~~~
enc, ct = parse(encrypted_origin_name)
aad = concat(encode(1, keyID),
             encode(2, kemID),
             encode(2, kdfID),
             encode(2, aeadID),
             encode(2, token_type),
             encode(1, token_key_id),
             encode(Nk, blinded_msg),
             encode(49, request_key),
             encode(32, name_key_id))
enc, context = SetupBaseR(enc, skI, "TokenRequest")
origin_name, error = context.Open(aad, ct)
~~~

# Anonymous Issuer Origin ID Computation {#anon-issuer-origin-id}

This section describes the Client, Attester, and Issuer behavior in computing
Anonymous Issuer Origin ID, the stable mapping based on client identity and
origin name. At a high level, this functionality computes y = F(x, k), where x
is a per-Client secret and k is a per-Origin secret, subject to the following constraints:

- The Attester only learns y if the Client in possession of x engages with the protocol;
- The Attester prevents a Client with private input x from running the protocol for input x' that is not equal to x;
- The Issuer does not learn x, nor does it learn when two requests correspond to the same private value x; and
- Neither the Client nor Attester learn k.

The interaction between Client, Attester, and Issuer in computing this
functionality is shown below.

~~~
Client               Attester                Issuer
    (request, signature)
  ---------------------->
                           (request, signature)
                         ---------------------->
                                (response)
                         <----------------------
~~~

The protocol for computing this functionality is divided into sections for
each of the participants. {{client-anon-issuer-origin-id}} describes Client behavior
for initiating the computation with its per-Client secret, {{attester-anon-issuer-origin-id}}
describes Attester behavior for verifying Client requests, {{issuer-anon-issuer-origin-id}}
describes Issuer behavior for computing the mapping with its per-Origin secret,
and {{attester-output-anon-issuer-origin-id}} describes the final Attester step for
computing the client-origin index.

The index computation is based on ECDSA {{ECDSA}} instantiated with P-384 and SHA-384 and
extended with key blinding support as described in {{KEYBLINDING}}. It uses the following
functions:

- ECDSA-KeyGen(): Generate a random ECDSA private and public key pair (sk, pk).
- ECDSA-BlindPublicKey(pk, r): Produce a blinded public key based on the input public
  key pk and blind r according to {{KEYBLINDING}}, Section 6.1.
- ECDSA-Verify(pk, msg, sig): Verify the DER-encoded {{X690}} ECDSA-Sig-Value signature
  sig over input message msg against the ECDSA public key pk, producing a boolean value indicating success.
- ECDSA-BlindKeySign(sk_sign, sk_blind, msg): Sign input message msg with signing key sk_sign and
  blind sk_blind according to {{KEYBLINDING}}, Section 6.2, and serializes the resulting signature
  pair (r, s) in "raw" form, i.e., as the concatenation of two 48-byte, big endian scalars.
- ECDSA-SerializePrivatekey(sk): Serialize an ECDSA private key using the Field-Element-to-Octet-String
  conversion according to {{SECG}}.
- ECDSA-DeserializePrivatekey(buf): Attempt to deserialize an ECDSA private key from a 48-byte
  string buf using Octet-String-to-Field-Element from {{SECG}}. This function can fail if buf
  does not represent a valid private key.
- ECDSA-SerializePublicKey(pk): Serialize an ECDSA public key using the
  compressed Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String method according to {{SECG}}.
- ECDSA-DeserializePublicKey(buf): Attempt to deserialize a public key using
  the compressed Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point method according to {{SECG}},
  and then performs partial public-key validation as defined in section 5.6.2.3.4 of
  {{!KEYAGREEMENT=DOI.10.6028/NIST.SP.800-56Ar3}}. This validation includes checking
  that the coordinates are in the correct range, that the point is on the curve, and
  that the point is not the point at infinity.

## Client Behavior {#client-anon-issuer-origin-id}

This section describes the Client behavior for generating an one-time-use
request key and signature. Clients provide their Client Secret as input
to the request key generation step, and the rest of the token request inputs
to the signature generation step.

#### Request Key {#index-request}

Clients produce `request_key` by masking Client Key and Client Secret with a
randomly chosen blind. Let `pk_sign` and `sk_sign` denote Client Key and
Client Secret, respectively. This process is done as follows:

1. Generate a random ECDSA private key, sk_blind.
1. Blind `pk_sign` with `sk_blind` to compute a blinded public key, `request_key`.
1. Output the blinded public key.

In pseudocode, this is as follows:

~~~
sk_blind = ECDSA-KeyGen()
blinded_key = ECDSA-BlindPublicKey(pk_sign, sk_blind)
request_key = ECDSA-SerializePublicKey(blinded_key)
request_blind = ECDSA-SerializePrivatekey(sk_blind)
~~~

### Request Signature {#index-proof}

Clients produce signature of their request based on the following inputs defined in {{request-one}}:
`token_key_id`, `blinded_msg`, `request_key`, `name_key_id`, `encrypted_origin_name`.
This process requires the blind value `sk_blind` produced during the {{index-request}} process.
As above, let pk and sk denote Client Key and Client Secret, respectively. Given these
values, this signature process works as follows:

1. Concatenate all signature inputs to yield a message to sign.
1. Compute an ECDSA signature with the blind `sk_blind` over the input message using
   Client Secret, `sk_sign` as the signing key.
1. Output the signature.

In pseudocode, this is as follows:

~~~
context = concat(0x0003, // token_type
                 token_key_id,
                 blinded_msg,
                 request_key,
                 name_key_id,
                 encrypted_origin_name)
request_signature = ECDSA-BlindKeySign(sk_sign, sk_blind, context)
~~~

## Attester Behavior (Client Request Validation) {#attester-anon-issuer-origin-id}

Given a TokenRequest request containing `request_key`, `request_signature`, and `request_blind`,
as well as Client Key `pk_blind`, Attesters verify the signature as follows:

1. Check that `request_key` is a valid ECDSA public key. If this fails, abort.
1. Check that `request_blind` is a valid ECDSA private key. If this fails, abort.
1. Blind the Client Key `pk_sign` by blind `sk_blind`, yielding a blinded key.
   If this does not match `request_key`, abort.
1. Verify `request_signature` over the contents of the request, excluding the
   signature itself, using `request_key`. If signature verification fails, abort.

In pseudocode, this is as follows:

~~~
blind_key = ECDSA-DeserializePublicKey(request_key)
sk_blind = ECDSA-DeserializePrivatekey(request_blind)
pk_blind = ECDSA-BlindPublicKey(pk_sign, sk_blind)
if pk_blind != blind_key:
  raise InvalidParameterError

context = parse(request[..len(request)-96]) // this matches context computed during signing
valid = ECDSA-Verify(blind_key, context, request_signature)
if not valid:
  raise InvalidSignatureError
~~~

## Issuer Behavior {#issuer-anon-issuer-origin-id}

Given an Issuer Origin Secret (denoted `sk_origin`) and a TokenRequest, from which
`request_key` and `request_signature` are parsed, Issuers verify
the request signature and compute a response as follows:

1. Check that `request_key` is a valid ECDSA public key. If this fails, abort.
1. Verify `request_signature` over the contents of the request, excluding the
   signature itself, using `request_key`. If signature verification fails, abort.
1. Blind `request_key` by Issuer Origin Secret, `sk_origin`, yielding an index key.
1. Output the index key.

In pseudocode, this is as follows:

~~~
blind_key = ECDSA-DeserializePublicKey(request_key)
context = parse(request[..len(request)-96]) // this matches context computed during signing
valid = ECDSA-Verify(blind_key, context, request_signature)
if not valid:
  raise InvalidSignatureError

evaluated_key = ECDSA-BlindPublicKey(request_key, sk_origin)
index_key = ECDSA-SerializePublicKey(evaluated_key)
~~~

## Attester Behavior (Index Computation) {#attester-output-anon-issuer-origin-id}

Given an Issuer response `index_key`, Client blind `sk_blind`, and Client
Key (denoted pk_sign), Attesters complete the Anonymous Issuer Origin ID computation as follows:

1. Check that `index_key` is a valid ECDSA public key. If this fails, abort.
1. Unblind the `index_key` using the Client blind `sk_blind`, yielding the index result.
1. Run HKDF {{!RFC5869}} with SHA-384 using the index result as the secret, Client Key
   `pk_sign` as the salt, and ASCII string "anon_issuer_origin_id" as the info string,
   yielding Anonymous Issuer Origin ID.

In pseudocode, this is as follows:

~~~
evaluated_key = ECDSA-DeserializePublicKey(index_key)
unblinded_key = ECDSA-UnblindPublicKey(evaluated_key, sk_blind)

index_result = ECDSA-SerializePublicKey(unblinded_key)
pk_encoded = ECDSA-SerializePublicKey(pk_sign)

anon_issuer_origin_id = HKDF-SHA384(secret=index_result,
                                    salt=pk_encoded,
                                    info="anon_issuer_origin_id")
~~~

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

This section describes security considerations relevant to the use of this protocol.

## Channel Security

An attacker that can act as an intermediate between Attester and Issuer
communication can influence or disrupt the ability for the Issuer to correctly
rate-limit token issuance.  All communication channels use server-authenticated
HTTPS. Some connections, e.g., between an Attester and an Issuer, require
mutual authentication between both endpoints. Where appropriate, endpoints
MAY use further enhancements such as TLS certificate pinning to mitigate
the risk of channel compromise.

## Information Disclosure {#info-disclosure}

The protocol in this document is designed such that information pertaining to issuance
of a token is limited to parties that need it for completing the protocol. In particular,
Attesters learn only the Anonymous Issuer Origin ID as described in {{anon-issuer-origin-id}},
any per-Client information necessary for attestation, and the target Issuer for a given
token request. The Attester does not learn the origin name associated with a given token
request.

The Issuer only learns the Attester that vouches for a particular Client's token request
and the origin name associated with a token request. The Issuer does not learn the
Anonymous Issuer Origin ID or any per-Client information used when creating a token request.

The Client learns the output token. It does not learn the Anonymous Issuer Origin ID.

## Token Request Unlinkability and Unforgeability {#issuance-unlinkability}

Client token requests are constructed such that an Issuer cannot distinguish between
any two token requests from the same Client and two requests from different Clients.
We refer to this property as issuance unlinkability. This property is achieved
by the way the tokens are constructed. In particular, TokenRequest.request_key and TokenRequest.request_signature
are the only value in a TokenRequest that is derived from per-Client information, i.e.,
the Client Secret.

TokenRequest.request_key is computed using a freshly generated blind for each token
request. As a result, the value of TokenRequest.request_key in one token request is
statistically independent from Client Key. Similarly, TokenRequest.request_signature
is computed using the same freshly generated blind as TokenRequest.request_key for each
token request, and the resulting signature is therefore independent from signatures
produced using Client Secret. More details about this unlinkability property can be
found in {{KEYBLINDING}}.

This unlinkability property is only intended for requests observed by the Issuer.
In contrast, the Attester is required to link requests from the same Client together
for the purposes of enforcing rate limits. This Attester does this by observing the
Client Key. Importantly, the Client Key is not sent to the Issuer during the issuance
flow, as doing this would allow the Issuer to trivially link two requests to the same
Client.

The token request signature is also required to be unforgeable. Informally, unforgeability
means that no entity can produce a valid (message, signature) pair for any blinding key without
access to the private signing key. Importantly, the means the Attester cannot forge
signatures on behalf of a given Client in an attempt to learn the origin name.

# Privacy Considerations {#privacy-considerations}

This section describes privacy considerations relevant to use of this protocol.

## Client Token State and Origin Tracking

Origins SHOULD only generate token challenges based on client action, such as when a user
loads a website. Clients SHOULD ignore token challenges if an Origin tries to force the
client to present tokens multiple times without any new client-initiated action. Failure
to do so can allow malicious origins to track clients across contexts. Specifically, an
origin can abuse per-user token limits for tracking by assigning each new client a random
token count and observing whether or not the client can successfully redeem that many
tokens in a given context. If any token redemption fails, then the origin learns information
about how many tokens that client had previously been issued.

By rejecting repeated or duplicative challenges within a single context, the origin only
learns a single bit of information: whether or not the client had any token quota left
in the given policy window.

## Origin Verification

Rate-limited tokens are defined in terms of a Client authenticating to an Origin, where
the "origin" is used as defined in {{?RFC6454}}. In order to limit cross-origin correlation,
Clients MUST verify that the origin_name presented in the TokenChallenge structure ({{AUTHSCHEME}})
matches the origin that is providing the HTTP authentication challenge, where the matching logic
is defined for same-origin policies in {{?RFC6454}}. Clients MAY further limit which
authentication challenges they are willing to respond to, for example by only accepting
challenges when the origin is a web site to which the user navigated.

## Client Identification with Unique Keys

Client activity could be linked if an Origin and Issuer collude to have unique keys targeted
at specific Clients or sets of Clients.

To mitigate the risk of a targeted Origin Name Key, the Attester can observe and validate
the token_key_id presented by the Client to the Issuer. As described in {{issuance}}, Attesters
MUST validate that the token_key_id in the Client's TokenRequest matches a known public key
for the Issuer. The Attester needs to support key rotation, but ought to disallow very rapid key
changes, which could indicate that an Origin is colluding with an Issuer to try to rotate the key
for each new Client in order to link the client activity.

## Origin Identification

As stated in {{properties}}, the design of this protocol is such that Attesters cannot
learn the identity of origins that Clients are accessing. The Origin Name itself is
encrypted in the request between the Client and the Issuer, so the Attester cannot
directly learn the value. However, in order to prevent the Attester from inferring the
value, additional constraints need to be added:

- Each Issuer SHOULD serve tokens a large number of Origins. A one-to-one relationship
between Origin and Issuer would allow an Attester to infer which Origin is accessed
simply by observing the Issuer identity.

- Issuers SHOULD NOT return rate-limit values that are specific to Origins, such
that an Attester can recognize an Origin simply by observing the rate limit. This
can be mitigated by having many Origins share the same rate-limit value, or by introducing
variability into return the rate-limit value.

Some deployments MAY choose to relax these requirements, such as in cases where the
origins being accessed are ubiquitous or do not represent user interaction.

## Collusion Among Different Entities {#collusion}

Collusion among the different entities in the Privacy Pass architecture can result in
exposure of a client's per-origin access patterns.

For this issuance protocol, Issuers and Attesters should be run by mutually distinct
organizations to limit information sharing. A single entity running an Issuer and Attester
for a single token issuance flow can view the origins being accessed by a given client.
Running the Issuer and Attester in this 'single Issuer/Attester' fashion reduces the privacy
promises of no one entity being able to learn Client browsing patterns. This may be desirable
for a redemption flow that is limited to specific Issuers and Attesters, but should be avoided
where hiding origin names from the Attester is desirable.

If a Attester and Origin are able to collude, they can correlate a client's identity
and origin access patterns through timestamp correlation. The timing of a request to an
Origin and subsequent token issuance to a Attester can reveal the Client
identity (as known to the Attester) to the Origin, especially if repeated over multiple accesses.

# Deployment Considerations {#deploy}

## Token Key Management

Issuers SHOULD generate a new (Token Key, Issuer Origin Secret) regularly, and
SHOULD maintain old and new secrets to allow for graceful updates. The RECOMMENDED
rotation interval is two times the length of the policy window for that
information. During generation, issuers must ensure the `token_key_id` (the 8-bit
prefix of SHA256(Token Key)) is different from all other `token_key_id`
values for that origin currently in rotation. One way to ensure this uniqueness
is via rejection sampling, where a new key is generated until its `token_key_id` is
unique among all currently in rotation for the origin.

# IANA considerations
